Simple windows application which shows you the requested city's current weather condition. 

This repository represent you an app which you can 
search a city name and the app gives you the current weather satuts of that city.
It also saves the data (your search results) which was collected through API (open weather map: current weather API ) into a table in MySql.


*** notice that you need to install the requirements.txt file via this command: pip install -r requirements.txt 

*** after that you'll need to create a data-base and also create a table with 6 columns 


Feel free to develop and request pulls to this, any time :)
