## General info
This repository represent you an app which you can search a city name and the app gives you the current weather satuts of that city, It also saves the data (your search results) which was collected through API into a table in SQLite.I used tkinter (which is python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package and is included in all standard python distributions) to create this app.

![DEMO](https://github.com/amirNourani/weather_app/blob/master/weather_app.gif)

```
$ cd weather_app/
